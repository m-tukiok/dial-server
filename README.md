dial-server for Mac
===================

A small patch of dial-server.js to support Mac OS X (tested with v10.11 El Capitan).
The original code was included in peer-dial/test (see https://github.com/fraunhoferfokus/peer-dial).
It will just simply launch Chrome in full-screen mode and works like YouTube app running on smart TVs :)

Usage:

  * use `npm install peer-dial` to install peer-dial module.
  * run `node dial-server.js`
